          This information is not an offer to invest in any token, Fund or other
          opportunity and is provided for information only. Past performance does not
          guarantee future results. Returns are calculated based on the rental
          payments distributed throughout the year and the appreciation in value
          of the underlying property. The appreciation in value is based on the
          difference between purchase price and annual property reappraisals.
          Individual investor returns may vary based on the timing of their
          investments and redemptions.
